<h6>My favourite activity is listening music</h6>

<p>
    I love listening music becuase it's scientifically proved that <b>listening music</b> helps overcoming the <b>stress</b>
    and also helps to <b>perform better</b> in all the regular aspects. Music makes me <b>happier</b> and it also enhances 
    running performances. <b>Music helps me sleeping better and it also reduces depression.</b> Music elevates my 
    <b>mood while driving</b>. <b>It strengthens learning and memory and also increases verbal intelligence</b>. Moreover, 
    when I get some free time, my first activity would be moving back to my playlist.

<h3>List of places that I would suggest to visit :-</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Goa</li>
    <li>Pondicherry</li>
    <li>Vizag</li>
    <li>Mumbai</li>
</ol>
<p>I would like to suggest these places to visit because all these places were coastal regions and all the four 
places were different from each other. All the four places were the most popular tourism spots in India. Not only 
the Indians, many foreigners prefer visiting these places.</p>
