<h6>My favourite activity is listening music</h6>
I love listening music becuase it's scientifically proved that <b>listening music</b> helps overcoming the <b>stress</b>
and also helps to <b>perform better</b> in all the regular aspects. Music makes me <b>happier</b> and it also enhances 
running performances. <b>Music helps me sleeping better and it also reduces depression.</i> Music elevates my 
<b>mood while driving</b>. <b>It strengthens learning and memory and also increases verbal intelligence</b>. Moreover, 
when I get some free time, my first activity would be moving back to my playlist.
